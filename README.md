# My Developer Environment Setup

Hello! This is my developer environment setup. I'm happy to share how I configure my workspace.
These are my dotfiles, but **note** that they might not work perfectly with your environment—this setup is specifically tailored for me.

## Usage

- **OS**: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) – I love its minimalism and the powerful package manager.
- **Window Manager**: [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/) – I prefer tiling window managers, and no, I'm not switching to Wayland!
- **Editor**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) – A better version of Vim—why not use it?
- **Shell**: [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) – I enjoy using Oh My Zsh themes.
- **Terminal Multiplexer**: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) – My favorite terminal multiplexer.

## Add-ons

1. **Rofi** – Application launcher
2. **Polybar** – Customizable status bar
3. **Tilix** – Terminal emulator

## Installation

I've included a `main.sh` script that simplifies the installation of what I consider essential tools for programming and general use.
